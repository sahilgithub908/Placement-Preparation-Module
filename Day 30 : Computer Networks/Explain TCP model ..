It is a compressed version of the OSI model with only 4 layers. It was developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1860s. The name of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).

1. Network Access/Link layer : Decides which links such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used
to meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer. Ex – Sonet, Ethernet
2. Internet : The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the whole
architecture together. It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be
delivered. Ex – IP, ICMP.
3. Transport : Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport layer. It
enables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation. Ex – TCP, UDP
(User Datagram Protocol)
4. Application : It contains all the higher-level protocols. Ex – HTTP, SMTP, RTP,
DNS
