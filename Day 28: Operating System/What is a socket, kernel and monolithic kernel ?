Socket:
A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication, A pair of processes communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets ,one for each process. A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
The server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is received, the server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete the connection.

Kernel is the central core component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. Kernel Establishes communication between user level application and hardware. Manages memory and CPU time. Decides state of incoming processes. Controls Disk, Memory, Task Management

Monolithic Kernel (provides good performance but lots of lines of code)
It is one of the types of kernel where all operating system services operate in kernel space. It has dependencies between system components. It has huge lines of code which is complex.
Example : Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400 etc.
