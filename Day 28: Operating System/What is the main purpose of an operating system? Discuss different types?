An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. So it manages the computer’s memory, processes, devices, files, and security aspects of the system. It also allows us to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language. Without an operating system, a computer is not useful.

Types of operating system:

Batch OS
Distributed OS
Multitasking OS
Network OS
Real-Time OS
Mobile OS
